        There are many kinds of Money but not all of them are legal tender or currency. Then we have central banks and
        fiat, gold-standard or debt-Money. How come that all countries have huge debts, but also most households? Who
        owns that debt? This page describes the basics that can be used for analysis or a good discussion.</p>

    I am not an economist. I will use generally accepted terminology as correctly as I can. However, situations are not
    approached like in mainstream economics, but rather as a kind-of physical system with oddities. For example, there
    will be no assumptions about the system being stationary or in equilibrium, unless this follows from analysis. Described systems will
    contain only <em>necessary</em> and <em>sufficient</em> elements, where elements can be anything that is relevant
    for the system, such as assumptions, conditions and laws of conservation. <a href="ref:note:WhyThisApproach" /> <a

    <p>
        Money can manifest itself in many ways. A promise to work or produced goods. A commodity that is traded for
        something else. It can be difficult to value, exchange or trust money. In modern societies there is often a
        specific kind of money that all participants in an economy are legally obliged to accept as payment: <em>legal
        tender</em>. Each economy has its own legal tender and accounting is done in that economy's <em>currency</em>.
        When not explicitly stated otherwise, <q>money</q> means <q>legal tender</q>. <a
            href="ref:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_tender">Legal tender on Wikipedia</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the modern world, there are often two types of legal tender: cash and money on a <em>transaction account</em>.<a
            href="ref:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_account">Transaction account</a>. With cash, paying
        means to physically transfer the cash on payment. A transaction account is often referred to as your bank
        account, checking account, current account or demand deposit account. A transaction account can be used to
        transfer money to other transaction accounts. In addition to transferring money between transaction accounts, it
        is also possible to add or remove money from them by exchanging equal amounts of cash.</p>
    <p>
        Any other type of money is still money, but not legal tender. I do not have to accept it as payment. Savings are
        not legal tender: the bank needs to transfer them to a transaction account first before they an be used in
        payment. Proof of asset (partial) ownership are also money, but first need to be exchanged for legal tender to
        use as payment.</p>

    <h2 id="143052da-75ae-484a-9927-b6de88b56512">Transactional payment rule</h2>
    <p>
        An important property of legal tender should be that <q>having a sufficient amount of legal tender implies a
        guaranteed ability to meet a financial obligation in a transactional sense</q>. <a
            href="ref:note:LegalTenderTransactionalityGuarantee"></a> For example if, at a specific point in time, I own
        one hundred units or more of legal tender and the price of a chair is one hundred units, this implies that at
        that specific moment in time, I can buy that chair. This sound rather cumbersome and superfluous, but not all <a
            href="#bda0eba7-de6d-4ea6-983e-f9bf8f7ed17f">payment systems</a> meet this requirement.</p>
</section>
<p>
    Cash, if it is valid legal tender, meets the <a href="#143052da-75ae-484a-9927-b6de88b56512">transactional payment
    rule</a> because it is something that physically exists and can change hands on demand.</p>
<section>
    <h2 id="bda0eba7-de6d-4ea6-983e-f9bf8f7ed17f">Payment system</h2>
    <p>
        In general, a payment system includes at least two aspects: cash and money on transaction accounts, each of
        which are interchangeable. A payment system should also have the <a
            href="#143052da-75ae-484a-9927-b6de88b56512">transactional payment rule</a> as one of its properties. </p>
</section>
<p>
    The payment system is an essential part of the economy that makes bartering with actual goods obsolete. In the past,
    bookkeeping ledgers would keep the number of actual good movements to a minimum. These ledgers can be considered the
    ancient version of a transaction account. If the payment system fails, the economy regresses to physical barter.
    Even worse: if the ledgers become lost, most people do not know what they own or cannot make claims that they do
    own. In other words: the economy would come to a standstill.</p>

    <h2 id="f9f38de8-c83d-4422-bf20-8fd2f419d6db">Currency</h2>
    <p>
        Keeping track of cash and transaction accounts is easy if al legal tender is counted the same way. Therefore, an
        economy uses a currency: a basic unit of legal tender. This is the number on a banknote or on your balance
        overview. </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2 id="f0142289-7f83-45f5-8b71-8c5fc5ee6b9d">Fiat money</h2>
    <p>
        In older societies there was only cash and ledgers. Cash often represented a certain amount of a commodity and
        could sometimes be exchanged for that. Until a few decades ago, the total worth of a county's currency equalled
        the amount of gold held by the central bank of that country: the gold standard.<a
            href="ref:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard">The gold standard</a> Even further back, each
        banknote was a claim on a certain amount of gold from that same central bank. For various and, no doubt,
        interesting reasons, this was abandoned pretty early in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
</section>
<p>
    At present, the total worth of a countries legal tender is just the amount of legal tender expressed in that
    economy's <a href="#f9f38de8-c83d-4422-bf20-8fd2f419d6db">currency</a>. Period. The value of that <em>currency</em>,
    however, is expressed relatively to other currencies and perhaps to the amount of a certain commodity, like gold.
    The price of a currency is whatever people are willing to pay for that currency in terms of commodities or other
    currencies. </p>

    <h2 id="06b49b68-67d4-4369-9df8-817bec5d3eee">Money system</h2>
    <p>
        Legal tender goes around in a combination of cash and transaction accounts. But how does legal tender come into
        existence? This can be done by printing banknotes, adding gold to the central bank's vaults, by upping the
        amount on transaction accounts or &hellip; <em>something else</em>. The combination of money creation and a
        payment system is the money system. </p>
</section>
<p>
    The current money systems in most economies is a combination of fiat money with transaction account money created as
    debt. This will be explained in more detail in <q><a href="page:42796614-4f45-49e3-aa37-cd5a81b2b2b8">Money as debt</a></q>.</p>

<aside id="ConservationIsNotEquilibrium">
    An atomic explosion adheres to laws of conservation perfectly, but is not generally seen as a system in equilibrium.
    The assumption that feedback is always negative and thus pushes a system to a stable state, is never assumed but
    should instead follow from reasoning &ndash; or not. This allows for unstable systems that are normally reasoned out
    by models that <em>do</em> assume equilibrium.
</aside>
<aside id="WhyThisApproach">
    The reason for all this is that I often meet a lot of hardwired thinking. Often, statements are presented as facts,
    even if they contradict. For example, in some discussions about <em>the same system</em> it is stated that <q>a
    loan always creates an equal amount of savings</q> in one situation and that <q>a loan is always spent back
    to eventually cancel the principal</q> in others. Due to the claim <q>always</q> these cannot be true in
    the same system. The formulation of these statements is often rather similar across discussions with different
    people. This could signal a common source, perhaps education. Either that source is missing appropriate boundary
    conditions and applicability, or the statements are used as an authoritative argument. <a
        href="ref:note:LogicalFallacies"></a> The bottom line is that I want to be in control of both the system and the
    situation and at the same time approach reality as well as possible. It is then possible to counter arguments with
    cross-contradictions or point to the assumptions and rules in the system.

<aside id="LegalTenderTransactionalityGuarantee">
    In my opinion, the ability to meet one's debt with enough legal tender, is an essential property of that legal
    tender. I haven't found any reference to this property in literature but must admit I did not do thorough research.
    Any help in in this regard is welcome. Naturally, I'm open to discussion, so a good reason not to consider this
    property part of legal tender, is also welcome&hellip;
</aside>
<aside id="LogicalFallacies">
    An authoritative argument is an example of a <em>logical fallacy</em>. It can be used to convince a discussion
    opponent: as we all know that <var>P</var>, where <var>P</var> might be made up, misquoted or not applicable to the
    situation at hand. See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies">Wikipedia</a> and <q><a
