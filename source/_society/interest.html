    <h1 id="article-summary-title">Can interest be payed without first taking on more, new debt?</h1>
    <p id="article-summary">
        In general, the person that lends out Money will ask interest payment. In the modern economy, bank credit <em>creates</em>
        money in the form of debt, while repaying debt <em>destroys</em> money.<a

            target="__money_creation_boe">Money creation in the modern economy</a> While the debt money is created, the
        interest that needs to be payed for the service is not. Some propose that it is <em>impossible</em> to pay that
        interest without someone (else) taking on more debt first. However, by considering money as a flow in a
        micro-scale closed system, it is easily shown that debt plus interest can be payed back without any problem in
        most cases. It is explored here what is necessary to &ldquo;close&rdquo; the debt and how time and interaction
        between this type of systems affects the flow and the behavior of money.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>The money system</h2>
    <p>
        The story is about the creation of money by lending the principal to an actor by another actor (the bank), the
        destruction of money by repaying the principal and paying between actors that include interest payments. To
        explain this behaviour, a <a href="page:42796614-4f45-49e3-aa37-cd5a81b2b2b8" chapter="7fedf684-abb0-4b48-891e-8ca7b1305c99">simple
        money debt based money system without a central bank</a> is perfect. </p>
</section>

<!--
<p>
    The scenarios that rule out <var>P</var> have the problem that all relevant transactions must be played in the exact
    right order. The scenarios that that correct timing by all actors is essential prove Howeverm not impossible , as it
    is not impossible . are also scenarios that describe that interest cannot be payed back without the need for extra
    debt. interest <em>can</em> be Proposition <var>P</var> is stronger than <var>R</var> in the sense that if we can
    find at least one valid and plausible scenario that supports it, that falsifies <var>R</var> and not the other way
    round. A perfect scenario to support <var>R</var> is described in <em>&ldquo;<a
        href="#a8f845bc-1d91-4006-9928-e917bf336a54">Scenario without necessity for additional debt</a>&rdquo;</em>. In
    this scenario, the interest is payed a while before the principal debt is due. The bank spends this interest back,
    after which it ends up at the debtor that can, as a result, repay its debt. The problem with this scenario is that
    the important steps have to be done in the exact right order and with a 100% efficiency. It fails when the
    interest-money spent by the bank does not completely end up at the debtor. It also fails if the bank does not spend
    the money until after the principal debt is due. In both &ldquo;inefficient&rdquo; cases, extra money is necessary
    and that implies already existing or new debt.<a href="ref:note:LegalTenderIsDebt"></a> However, what happens when a
    bank decides not to spend the interest money or keep it for a while? There could be side-effects that shift other
    balances that in the end free money to pay the interest. Is it possible that the delay of interest-spending by the
    bank is fixed by credit that is already there? This leads to three aspects that are investigated here. The first one
    is timing: what are the dependencies between transactions that are part of a debt and its principal and interest
    repayment. The second one is loss: what happens when interest is not completely cyclic, leading to a necessity of
    additional debt? Can it be fixed? The third one relates to both: is it possible to consider the whole money-debt
    system as a stationary system where relations between debts can be ordered to convenience to solve problems? The
    latter is important, as most economic systems tend to be formulated in a stationary way and a lot of those as if
    they are always in equilibrium. </p>
-->

<!-- This makes it easy to alter the example a little so that it suddenly seems
to support <var>P</var>.
Even though there is a perfect example that supports There is a valid and some scenarios The original proposition is
stronger than the opposite: as soon as a non-zero percentage of plausible scenarios There is at least one scenario,
<a href="#a8f845bc-1d91-4006-9928-e917bf336a54">direct spending of interest</a>, where both debt and interest are
payed back without the need for additional debt. The existence of such an example proves that it is not impossible
to do so and that, therefore, the proposition is wrong. However, &ldquo;not impossible&rdquo; does not imply &ldquo;always
possible&rdquo;. There is another scenario where the bank frustrates the earlier scenario and additional debt is
needed to pay the original debt and interest. Reality is a mix of possible scenarios, so <em>on average</em>, it is
not possible to <em>completely</em> payback the interest without someone taking on more debt first. Or is it?


. this means it is not impossible to is repaid and the interest and the both the debt is repayed and the interest is
payed Some will say that it is <em>mathematically impossible</em> to repay both debt and the additional interest
without taking more debt first. This position can be falsified right away, as there is at least one scenario &ndash;
<a href="#a8f845bc-1d91-4006-9928-e917bf336a54">direct spending of interest</a> &ndash; were both are payed back
without taking more debt in advance. In this scenario, the interest is payed just before all (principal) repayment
is due. Via purchases by the bank itself, this payed interest then ends up at the debtor, who can then repay the
rest of the debt. The interest is, so to say, a hundred percent <em>cyclic</em>. So it is not impossible to repay
both debt and the interest. However, "not impossible" does not imply "always possible". Some jump to the conclusion
that interest must always be cyclic and that it is therefore always possible to repay both debt and interest. There
are two very important assumptions necessary to support such an argument. The first is that timing cannot not play a
role: see <a href="#cb94120d-8c28-431c-b92b-45ec6ed28bb9"><em>Timing problems</em></a>. The second is that the
interest-cycle is a hundred percent efficient: see <a href="#baf4ee8e-9614-444f-9bbf-0386aa2070f3"><em>Loss
problems</em></a>. If these assumptions don't always hold, further analysis needs to prove that side-effects counter
for loss or delay, fully.
<p>
Timing, loss problems and side-effects will be explored here. When that is done, a conclusion can be drawn. As of
this writing &ndash; September 25<sup>th</sup> 2017 &ndash; I do not know the outcome, as this is still a work in
progress (W.I.P.)

            href="ref:http://positivemoney.org/2017/02/interest/">Positive Money &ndash; is there enough money to pay

<p>
    Alice the entrepreneur wants to borrow 100 credits. George agrees and demands 10% interest. The 100 credits are
    called the <em>principal </em> of the loan, due in a year. The 100 credits are added to Alice's balance and in one
    year from now, Alice needs to repay George 100 credits and an extra 10 credits as interest: a total of 110 credits.
</p>
<p>
    Alice first buys a machine from Pete (50 credits) that enables her to create stuff. She also buys bread from Bob (10
    credits). During the year, Bob, Alice and Pete exchange money on their balances for goods. Alice makes "stuff", Bob
    bread and Pete machines. Naturally, Alice makes sure she has the 100 credits back in time to repay her debt. </p>
<p>
    Just before the principal and interest are due, Alice pays George the interest in advance: her balance becomes 90
    and George's 10 credits. Now George buys 10 credits of breads from Bob and Bob uses that to buy 10 credits of
    "stuff" from Alice, so Alice, again, has 100 credits. Then she repays George, who dutifully resets her balance to
    zero.<a href="ref:note:FactsAndRules"/> In numbers: </p>

    <h2>What's wrong with this story?</h2>
    <p>Even though the story proves that it is not mathematically <em>impossible</em> to repay debt and the additional
        interest: it is a rather contrived story: all inhabitants must make the right decisions at the right time.
        Reality is messy, so this "model" of a society is too simplistic. Let's make it more interesting! </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Work in Progress as of 2017-09-09</strong>
    </p>
</section>

<aside id="FactsAndRules">
    <p>Here are some facts and rules on the island:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FACT1</strong>: The island has four inhabitants: George, Alice, Bob and Pete</li>
        <li><strong>FACT2</strong>: The island has one bank, worth 1000 credits and owned by George. The credits
            actually were rare stones.
        </li>
        <li><strong>FACT3</strong>: None of the inhabitants except George, have stones, though they can have other
            property but that is not generally acceptable as payment.
        </li>
        <li><strong>FACT4</strong>: All the inhabitants, including George, have a balance at George's bank, that starts
            out empty. People used to carry around the original stones from George that made up the bank. Now, the
            balances are just numbers. But the stones might still be there!
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE1</strong>: Nobody is legally bound to accept anything but balance payments. In other words:
            number on balances are the only possible legal tender.
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE2</strong>: If asked, George can add a number to an inhabitant's (debtor's) balance that
            represents the principal of a loan. A represents a debt that must be repaid in a limited amount of time. In
            addition, the debtor will pay a negotiated percentage of interest per year over the amount of the principal
            that has not yet been repaid.
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE3</strong>: The bank is only allowed to lend out as much money as it is worth, or a fixed
            multiple thereof: leverage
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE4</strong>: Repaying debt means that George lessens the amount on the balance of the inhabitant.
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE5</strong>: Paying interest means that the inhabitant's balance is decreased with the same
            amount that George's balance gets increased.
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE6</strong>: It is possible for inhabitants to become partial owner of the bank by allowing the
            bank to diminish their accounts in exchange for ownership-papers.
        </li>
    </ul>

</aside>

<aside id="LegalTenderIsDebt">
    In all scenarios, there are facts to take into account and rules to play by.<a href="ref:note:FactsAndRules"/> In
    this case: interest can only be payed with legal tender: money on a balance account. The only way to obtain money on
    a balance account is to take on debt.<a href="ref:note:CashCurrency"/> Hence, if the interest (in the <a
        href="#a8f845bc-1d91-4006-9928-e917bf336a54">direct spending of interest</a> scenario) is not fully spent before
    the payback is due, other money needs to be available to repay the remainder. This money is debt that was already in
    circulation or a temporary new debt that must be taken.
</aside>
<aside id="CashCurrency">
    In this system, cash is not considered. Cash can be exchanged for balance account money. The large majority of
    money, however, is debt. It might be interesting to see how the quantitative aspects of the whole money-debt system
    turn out to see what the role of cash is.
</aside>

<aside id="OneOnOneLendingRisk">
    It is often claimed that the described money system &ndash; that is similar to the current money system &ndash;
    reduces the so-called one on one lending risk: If I lend my money to someone, there is always the chance that I will
    not get it back, let alone the added interest. In the described system, I can put money in a savings account at the
    bank. As the bank creates money for loans rather than lending out these savings, it is concluded that the system
    prevents the one to one lending risk. Though this is true, it is true for any money system. It is always possible to
    create mediator, a fund where many people put their savings and where that fund lends out part of that money to many
    other people, thereby taking away the one on one lending risk. This is actually how most people think a banks work.
    As a follow up argument it is then stated that the risk of participating in such a fund, is higher than a bank
    creating new money on lending. However, if you trace all risk a little more thoroughly, there really not that much
    difference.
