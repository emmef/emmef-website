*1. Argument debunking of "Russia did not have a choice"* (3:03)

This thesis is a simplification and interpretation of several things Mearsheimer said. Falsifying this synthetic, interpreted claim does not falsify these "several things that Mearsheimer said", and suggesting it does, is a classic "straw-man" logical fallacy.[1]

Stubb then laments on Russian history, sensitiveness, paranoia and so on. While he may be morally, historically and emotionally correct, he provides no arguments that this perspective is better than the realpolitik's "practical" perspective that is explicitly devoid of morality or emotion.[2] He is simply using a different theory, without explaining why it would apply better under the circumstances. Without arguments explaining this, his lament constitutes an appeal to emotion or, because he is a scholar and ex-politician, an appeal to authority (because you must take his word for it instead of that of Mearsheimer). Both appeals are, again, logical fallacies.

Stubb continues with the argument that Russia should not feel threatened by NATO. There is a lot to say about that, but let's stick to the fact that if a country is paranoid and feels threatened, IT FEELS THREATENED, whether that is justified or not. He strengthens that himself by saying that Russia has always been paranoid and always felt threatened, which voids his own "should not feel threatened" argument. In addition, according to Mearsheimer and various, documented diplomatic sources, Russia has been telling us for over 15 years that it sees NATO membership of Ukraine as an existential threat, that this NATO membership would never happen, and that it would rather wreck the country. And this is not just Putin's opinion, but the opinion of the Kremlin, including Putin's fiercest critics and on all levels.[3]

Later Stubb mentions that he strongly disagrees that Russia is a bona-fide country that looks to defend itself from Ukraine. This is also a claim that Mearsheimer does not make. He just talks about what countries do to defend their interests, whatever they are, and whether the actions are moral or not.[1] Mearsheimer also does not say that Russia wants to defend itself from Ukraine, but rather to the NATO influence: not a subtle difference! The fact that Russia is bona-fide or not, has nothing to do with the thesis Stubb tries to debunk. Another straw-man.

I agree with Dr. Stubb that Russia "did not have to do this." However, as he argues himself, Russia is a paranoid an expansionist country. It also made a promise, for over 15 years now. This basically strengthens Mearsheimer's point about NATO expansion. Russia just kept its promise by "doing it". That does not make it right or moral, but it was perfectly predictable from the realpolitik perspective and by arguments Dr. Stubb gave himself.[1] Again, Russia did not have to do it. On the other hand, we "did not have to make Ukraine a de facto NATO member", knowing Russia's stance on the matter and Russia as a paranoid, expansionist country (Stubb's words) with a huge nuclear arsenal. And despite Germany and France seeing this conflict coming. You can expect a country like Russia to look right through all the rhetoric about denial of "de jure" NATO membership, but at the same time making it a "de facto" member end 2021. Nobody will know whether less pressure to join NATO would have prevented this war. However, Stubb also does not provide arguments that the war would have happened anyway if we "did not do it".

In this first counter, Dr. Stubb not only uses flawed reasoning, but by mixing in his own arguments actually strengthens Mearsheimer's position.

*CONCLUSION:* Prof. Stubb FAILED to debunk anything Mearsheimer or Realists claim, and weakened his own position.

In his Realpolitik theory, there is an explicit disconnect between morality and ethics, and what nations do to protect what they deem as their national interests. The actions are often immoral and the interests are generally the interests of a small group. But that is beside the point. If a realist says that an action follows from a realpolitik perspective, it does not mean that this realist agrees with that action as a person.

*2. Argument debunking "Putin made a rational decision"* (5:18)
_(This response is an (unfortunately) re-added follow-up on my earlier comment, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlB-pRqdyBg&lc=UgwGmIgugqgDCQfBSC54AaABAg, where I explain that his video is insincere and misleading.)_

According to Stubb, Mearsheimer says Putin made a rational decision, and expansion led Russia to attack Ukraine. Stubb disagrees, and thinks the fact that Putin made a tactical and strategic blunder provides the case in point: the choice he made led to the exact inverse of what he intended.

If somebody has a certain intention and, based on a theory of reality,  makes a decision, the fact that the outcome doesn't pan out, proofs that the theory is wrong or incomplete, _not_ that the decision itself was irrational. The decision was rational according to the theory and that theory happened to fail reality. To further proof that Putin was irrational, Dr. Stubb uses present knowledge that Putin could never have had at the time of his decision. Putin's theory might not have included the West doubling down on the war. Without that, Putin's intentions might have worked out. Who knows? His decision might not have been morally justifiable, but that was not the point here.

Dr. Stubb might be right when he talks about Putin's ambitions, but Putin also mentioned that "he who wanted to realise those, has no brains", though that statement could be a lie. But, again, this has nothing to do with the argument that Putin was or was not acting rationally. Another evasive counter.

Even if we accept that Putin was not acting rationally according to his or our theories, Dr. Stubb wants us to take his word that Mearsheimer is wrong when he says that NATO expansion led to the invasion. However, he does not provide evidence or reason at that time, which reduces it to a mere opinion. Which he is entitled to, of course. He makes no effort to waylay any arguments by Mearsheimer that explained why NATO expansion did lead to the invasion, rational or not. Please focus on these arguments and not a flawed rebuke like this.

*CONCLUSION:* Stubb FAILED debunk the argument and just states his opinion, that can partially be deemed speculative as he does not refer to the actual explanation.




*3. Argument debunking "Ukraine should subdue"* (8:03)
_(This response is an (unfortunately) re-added follow-up on my earlier comment, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlB-pRqdyBg&lc=UgwGmIgugqgDCQfBSC54AaABAg, where I explain that his video is insincere and misleading.)_

This is the first argument Dr. Stubb debunks, that Mearsheimer actually made! Stubb adds that this means that for peace, Ukraine has to compromise on its values, security and politics, and basic existence. In my opinion, this is not a conclusion you can draw from what Mearsheimer said, but I will let this one pass.

Stubb disagrees with Mersheimer, and poses that every country is entitled to be sovereign. I wholeheartedly want that to be true. However, Mearsheimer has a number of strong arguments why such a state of affairs is not attainable. Stubb addresses neither of those arguments and fails to provide a practical way to achieve this state, until mentions the UN charter.

Stubb uses the UN charter as an argument. First, theoretically, having to adhere to a charter contradicts having a sovereign foreign policy. I'll leave that. Second, because you must be _consistent._ NATO (countries) routinely violate the charter with non UN-sanctioned wars, executed as NATO or subgroups thereof. This disqualifies NATO as "defensive" and makes it unreliable. So who has to adhere to the charter and who does not? Who decides? Finland joined the Iraq war that was not sanctioned by the UN and based on a false pretext. For what? Rule-based order?[1]

This second argument is definitely how-about-ism, but that cannot be used as a blanket dismissal. As we are talking about consequences of acts and moral issues, and using the charter as a solution but at the same time allowing it to be ignored systematically, undoes your argument.

Then he goes on to say that every country should be able to choose the security framework that it belongs to. But there is also a chapter in the UN charter that says that "a nation may not increase its security by diminishing that of another." According to Russia, that is exactly what Ukraine does by joining NATO, and given NATO's regular violations of the charter, it might have a point. In addition, the US does not allow any country on the western hemisphere to join any other foreign security alliance.[2] Again a double standard here.

Dr. Stubb's theory is exactly what it is: a theory. But also a utopia. Sovereignty for all does not work in practice. Mightier countries get away with more and can subdue other countries at will, with or without a UN charter, see also . That proves some points Mearsheimer makes. You can, of course, omit the double standard. But that is hypocrisy, especially from someone from Finland. Finland that joined the Iraq war that was not sanctioned by the UN and was based on a false pretext.

*4. Argument debunking "This conflict is due to NATO expansion"* (10:55)
_(This response is an (unfortunately) re-added follow-up on my earlier comment, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlB-pRqdyBg&lc=UgwGmIgugqgDCQfBSC54AaABAg, where I explain that his video is insincere and misleading.)_

Stubb first argues that the door to NATO was never open to Ukraine, because it was blocked by France and Germany. He is correct in the sense that Ukraine is not an *official* NATO member yet, and might never become one. However, If we read various official publications by NATO and the US government, the door was always open and Ukraine is a de facto member since November 2021.[4] Failing to mention this is at the least sloppy and insincere, and the conclusion he arrives at is false, or at least a great misrepresentation..

Stubb meanders about the history of NATO and the NATO expansion in Europe. This is fina and illustrative. But then (12:37) he argues that NATO was never aggressive and its very existence has been a guarantee for peace. However, NATO has violated the UN charter various times and prominent NATO members routinely do so and violate international law.[5] In addition, the most prominent member, the US, that has deep involvement or cooperation with most NATO members, regularly commit war crimes, and does not allow nations on the Western hemisphere the sovereignty to choose the security alliance the want (see Cuba crisis and the US aggression that led to it) and meddles in their governance all the time.[6] This time, Stubbs gives a lot of information, but also leaves out rather essential information that is remarkably easy to find, to therefore arrive at a conclusion that is simply untrue. This argument is void.

Then he starts about Georgia. He disconnects it from NATO expansion and labels it as an expansionist act of aggression. However, 2008 Bucharest summit declaration explicitly states that the door is open for both Ukraine and Georgia.[4] In addition, and as mentioned earlier, it was well known in diplomatic circles that Russia did see NATO membership of Ukraine and Georgia as a threat (Let me come back to that later). William Burns, the US ambassador (now head CIA) also confirmed that it was not just Putin thinking that, but the whole Kremlin, including Putin's rivals.[3] Especially if he was there as a negotiator, as he states, he must have known all this. So the argument that the skirmishes had nothing to do with NATO expansion is void. As he also does not explain that the _actual drive_ was "expansionist behaviour to create instability", that is opinion or speculation that he uses as an authoritative argument, a logical fallacy.

*CONCLUSION:* Given the blatant omission or misrepresentation of easily available public and official information and tying it together with speculation and authoritative reasoning, this argument is completely bogus.

Further responesed:


If only one school of thought is represented in public discourse, something is wrong. If more schools are represented, they should not just fight each other. They should define boundary conditions where each school delivers the best results or, better, come to a common theory that is better than both. I do not see this happen in schools of international relations. In addition, Western governance excludes schools like realpolitik in both politics and media.
Therefore, it is excellent that after more than a decade, Realpolitik, represented by Mearsheimer, was back at the Western table again, thanks to STG. Because whether you agree with Mearsheimer or not: he has some important insights that he supports thoroughly with theory and logical reasoning. Though I must say I dislike his recent adoption of reading Tea-leaves in Putin speeches like his opponents do. I also think it is an excellent idea to counter some of Mearsheimers argument.

According to Mearsheimer's arguments, present Western governance leads to a grim future and possible extinction. Therefore, I hope that our Western justify that governance by superior knowledge and reasoning when compared to Mearsheimer. I cross my fingers that this video does not represent that superiority. Dr. Stubb's response is full of logical fallacies and debating tricks that have no place in academic discourse, see my previous response [1]. The worst of it is that he unintentionally strengthens the very points that Mearsheimer makes.

Instead of an open discourse, this video is a political narrative, aimed at emotion and confirmation. It would be fine if it were announced as that: I would skip it. But this video pretends to be more and that makes it pseudoscience or even propaganda. To be clear, Putin is a thug and a war criminal, and I hope Mearsheimer's theory is wrong. But this video just advertises the conviction of one egocentric school of thought, that is not willing to find the better, common theory. And if the field of international relations is driven by this school, we are doomed.

[EDIT: corrected "Mersheimer" to Mearsheimer"]

I want Dr. Mearsheimer to be wrong, but Mr. Stubb does not help me in that!

In my opinion, the answer to the question "Who gives Putin the right to take decision on behalf on another country?"  is: "No one, as he shouldn't have that right, as it violates rule-based order." But to be honest, this is a theoretical answer. So let's dive a little deeper.

Rule-based order only works when applied consistently. This leads to follow-up questions:
(a) Are violations allowed? (b) If so: who may violate?  (c) If so: who decides that? (d) Based on what?
In case of violations:
(e) Who gets punished? (f) Who decides and (g) based on what?


I would preferably answer these questions as follows, where "na" means "not applicable":
(a)=no, (b)=none, (c)=na, d=na, e=everyone, f=na, g=na.
These are compatible with the answer I gave for Putin. But the answers of three decades of recent history suggest different answer, namely:
(a)=no, (b)=In most cases, the West (TW), (c)=TW, d=Yes we can, e=Others than TW f=TW, g=Yes we can.

There is an abundance of evidence that the West, say the  US, NATO and various alliances of NATO and non-NATO members, far more often than Russia, violated the rules: the UN-charter, the "right to choose a security alliance of choice" and international law in general. In practice, we don't give a damn about the sovereignty of countries without our "enlightened" domestic policy and economic ideology, even though things like that are essential to that very sovereignty.

So we do not apply rule-based order consistently. Some countries are basically more equal than others.

Now, that we violate rule-based order so much, does not mean that Russia should also be encouraged to do so. However, by accusing and punishing only a subset of nations for similar violations, rule-based order breaks. We impose  our own "our argumentative view of a bully" on the rest of the world and, ironically, confirm Mearsheimer's thesis about "might is right". Do note that Realpolitik states this as "model of how things work" and explicitly separates this from whether it is morally justified: when moral is in the way of defending a nation's interests, it goes off the table.

Naturally, we will never allow ourselves introspection. Given the last three decades of history, many countries see the West as a threat and find NATO's "defensive" qualifier laughable. As the UN charter also states that "No nation has the right to improve its security by diminishing that of others/neighbours", you might even say that Russia has a point. Let me be clear that this can never be a justification for starting a war. However, I think it is also "not done" to bring another country in a situation like this, by ignoring its concerns for more than 15 years.

In my opinion, this war could have been prevented. First being consistent in applying rule-based order. And second,  by not opening the door to Ukraine NATO membership in 2008. Even the cold-war USSR and USA struck a compromise that Cuba would not join the Warsaw-pact, even though American aggression and meddling was the reason it wanted to join that pact in the first place. Also check out the "Monroe doctrine", that still holds. Then we'll talk about sovereignty.
