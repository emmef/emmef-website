*This video is insincere and misleading*

The title of the video should be: "This is what I believe about five topics that Mearsheimer mentions." In that case, it reflects the content, and you can agree with it or not: fine! 

Contrary to its title, this video _does not explain_ why Mearsheimer is wrong - read below why - and at the same time puts Stubbs colleague Mearsheimer at a disadvantage. With Stubb as a public academic figure, this functions as an authoritative argument (a logical fallacy) to exclude the person Mearsheimer from public discourse (ad hominem, a logical fallacy) because all his contributions to the discourse have been invalidated by an authority, which is enough for most people. This false premise then results in a narrower public discourse. For this reason, I find the video insincere, misleading, and it contradicts the "open public discourse" that Stubb advocates at the beginning. Because there is no discussion: just Stubb's _opinion_ packaged as a rebuke. Read below why this is important and dangerous.

*Why this video does not explain anything*
If you analyse the logical structure and premises of Stubb's arguments, he does not actually address nor falsify any claims that Mearsheimer made. I suggest you read about logical fallacies to find out why, or read my previous comment about it (links below). Instead, the video tells you what prof. believes, and is selective with facts. Naturally, you can agree with Stubb, in which this video helps with confirmation bias, not with explaining why you have that bias.

*Why this is important*
As a society, we are losing the craft of critical thinking and scrutiny. Critical thinking and good discussions with multiple viewpoints present, and where one's own viewpoints are also scrutinized, are critical for democracy. However, more and more we see only one viewpoint in public debate or even in science, wherever you are. More and more people confuse "doing analysis" with "being told conclusions, often from a single source. More and more people fall trap to what constitutes to cheap debating tricks that convince, but are incorrect logical reasoning. If we loose the ability to discern nonsense, and propaganda from reality, we loose our ability to choose, and others will choose for us.

Seeing a representative of the academic world of international relations produce a narrative like this, with truly bad quality of reasoning, and a misleading selection of information: that underlines my point perfectly. If this is the level of advice that our governments consume, and the media collaborate in suppressing alternative viewpoints, the weapons manufacturers will laugh their asses off until we all perish.
