<h1>What is science?</h1>
<p>
    Are all masters curricula at universities <em>scientific</em>? Is something likely
    because it follows from solid reasoning based upon previous research or just because
    some authority says so? And what makes someone an authority? Is it solid research or
    many references in prestigious journals? Which boils down to authority again, as what makes these
    journals prestigious? Is it because the majority of its publications can be reproduced and
    withstand many attempts to falsify them? But that is also true if the journal and the community
    both stay safely within the limits of the mainstream and never put the fundamentals of that
    mainstream to actual scrutiny. As a result, the community will not leave the mainstream as that
    would mean no or less prestigious publication, which means less income. This is a lock-in.

    The above questions are important in a world where policy is affected enormously by just a few sciences. Especially
    when governments diminish spending in fundamental sciences that are then payed by commercial parties. It is impossible
    for laymen &ndash; most politicians &ndash; to distinguish between honest science and science that is tailored to
    produce results that especially favor the interests of the sponsor. Publication bias, retracted research whose
    results are "common knowledge" that has <em>not</em> been retracted. For example: Nobel laureate Friedrich von Hayek
    warned for the influence of economic science on society <a href="ref:note:Hayek"/>.

<h1>Using math does not imply doing science</h1>
<p>
    It is fundamental to understand that expressing a thought or model in mathematical form does not make it
    science.
    Mathematics is a great tool to explore, expand and derive theoretical models. However, it needs valid input. 
    Input consists of assumptions (axioms) and other models. In most cases, input is accompanied by boundary conditions
    that define exactly when the mapping from the input to the mathematical model holds and thus when it breaks. 
    The boundary conditions are important meta-data for the resulting model and must accompany al results 
    from it. Applying the model without regard for the boundary conditions, results in faulty results. Building 
    new models on top of it without propagating the boundary conditions, results in unreliable models.    
</p>
</section>
<p>
    Mathematics can produce perfectly consistent models but they reflect the quality of the input and are only valid
    within the boundary conditions. If the assumptions are bogus or unverified, the result will be consistent
    but describe a bogus world. If the boundary conditions are ignored, the outcomes are likely to be invalid and
    place new models based on it, at jeopardy. That is a large pitfall.
</p><p>
    There are other pitfalls. There are many
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies" target="fallacies">logical fallacies</a> that can seep
    into reasoning and research. These can be hard to detect or contradict and this is why they are exploited in debating
    techniques. With a solid debating technique a discussion is easily won, even if the opponent has the better
    arguments.

        Hayek</a> Won the 1974 Nobel memorial prize <a href="ref:note:nobelprize"/> and gave

                    target="__blank">Banquet speech</a> in which he said:</p><blockquote>&ldquo;<em>Yet I must confess that if I had been consulted whether to establish
        a Nobel Prize in economics, I should have decidedly advised against it.</em><br/>
        (&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;) <br/>
        <em>It is that the Nobel Prize confers on an individual an authority which in economics no man ought to
            possess. This does not matter in the natural sciences. Here the influence exercised by an
            individual is chiefly an influence on his fellow experts; and they will soon cut him down to
            size if he exceeds his competence. But the influence of the economist that mainly matters is an
            influence over laymen: politicians, journalists, civil servants and the public generally.
