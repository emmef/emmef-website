    <h1 id="article-summary-title">Causality</h1>
    <p id="article-summary">
        Can one event affect another? Could one event have caused another? In relativity, causality and events are everything. But forget your intuition, for events can be caused by events that happened <em>after</em> them, as time is subjective. Causality travels with the speed of light but things without mass don't even experience time! If all this is strange, let's bring out Quantum mechanics! Here we have things that behave like particles or waves, depending on how you look at them. Or stuff that is so entangled that measuring one affects the other <em>immediately and independent of distance</em>. This is what we will talk about. There is a lot of debate about whether this entanglement <em>violates</em> causality according to relativity. I might be completely wrong, but I think it does not. Not always.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    Much more learned and intelligent people created great introductions to relativity,<a href="ref:note:intros_to_relativity"/> so I will not do that here. This article mainly focuses on special relativity that is limited to flat spacetime. To understand this article, it is especially important to be familiar with lifeline, spacetime interval, the role it plays in causality and light cones.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong><br />
    I am not a physicist and merely interested in the subject. At this stage, the text below is merely a draft.
</p>
<h2>Causality according to relativity</h2>
<p>
    According to relativity the speed of causality, \(c\), is limited and equal to the speed of light in a vacuum. In addition, things without mass must move with \(c\), while things with mass can only move slower than the \(c\).<a href="ref:note:mass_speed_space"/> If event <var>A</var> causes or affects event <var>B</var>, there is a causal relation in the order \(A \implies B\). Note, that this not necessarily the same as <var>A</var> <em>comes before</em> <var>B</var>, as time is subjective. Assume that  <var>A</var> occurs at \(t =0\) and position \(\vec{x}=0\). Event <var>A</var> can only cause or affect events within its "causality-bubble" that can be seen as a sphere that starts at \(\vec{x}=0\) and a radius \(r\) that grows in (proper) time with \(c\).<a href="ref:note:folding_space"/>

<h2>Causality according to quantum mechanics</h2>
<p>
    In quantum mechanics, the way we do a measurement on a subject, affects how the subject represents itself, e.g. as a particle or a wave. When the subject is part of an entangled pair of subjects, measurement on one subject will affect the other subject <em>immediately</em>. If we do measurements on both subjects and see them as events \(M_1\) and \(M_2\), there is a causal relation in the order \(M_1 \implies M_2\). This relation is <em>immediate</em>. This contradicts what relativity says, namely that \(M_1\) can only affect \(M2\) if it happens inside its causality-bubble.</p>
<p>
<h2>Falsify causalities</h2>
<p>
    Lets devise an experiment that uses entangled subjects and that ensures that \(M_2\) lies <em>outside</em> the causality-bubble of \(M_1\). This experiment, will either falsify instantaneous or speed-limited causality. Fortunately, this experiment already exists and is called the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed-choice_quantum_eraser" target="wikipedia_delayed_choice_quantum_eraser">delayed-choice quantum eraser</a>&rdquo;. The delayed-choice quantum eraser shows that the effect of \(M_1\) on \(M_2\) is <em>immediate</em>. Which leads to the conclusion that causality according to relativity is dead. Or is it?
</p>
<h1>Is relativistic causality falsified?</h1>
<p>
    At a first glance, it is definitely falsified. As in order for \(M_1\) to affect \(M_2\), information must be passed from \(M_1\) to \(M_2\) and that cannot travel faster that \(c\). But there is something weird going on. All actual implementations of the eraser use photons. That is not weird, but photons are.
</p>
<h2>Subjects without mass: photons</h2>
<p>
    Photons have no mass and thus move with the speed of causality: \(c\). That means that their spacetime interval is zero during the time that they exist. They do not experience that time themselves, as there is no relative interval between events in their whole life and therefore, a causal ordering makes no sense. All events could be the same or affect each other. In other words: the creation and destruction and all that happens in-between, happens instantaneously from the perspective of the photon. But that is the photon's perspective.
</p>
<p>
    An observer <em>does</em> experience time and can conclude that the photon is created and, depending on whether an interaction occurs, lives on or gets destroyed <em>later</em>. In some cases, the observer is even able to affect the photons journey or measure (and kill) it.<a href="ref:note:knowing_whether_a_photon_exists"/>
</p>
<p>
    So there is this photon in timeless limbo and the time-bound observer. If the observer does not measure the photon, there is only a likelihood that the photon is where observer thinks it is at that time. When the observer measures the photon in some way, it ceases to exists in exchange for some of its information. This looks a lot like the behaviour of a wave function. But there is a relativistic aspect to it that is spooky. According to the observer, the spooky-function results in a fast moving probability to be somewhere until it collapses because of an interaction (measurement). This is like the wave function of a particle with speed \(c\) and mass \(E_{photon} / c^2\) in a non-relativistic universe. According to the photon, the spooky-function is spread out between its creation and its destruction and it hasn't the faintest idea what caused what. This is eerie.
</p>
<p>
    If we add entanglement to the mix, the question is whether this spooky-function stretches out across <em>both</em> entangled photons in the experiment. In that case, all events that happen to both photons are instantaneous from the perspective of the photons. In which case there is a strange causal relation between the measurements \(M_1\) and \(M_2\) that has zero-interval. Both could influence each other without any perceived time difference. But this does not contradict relativity. It only creates an exception from the causality bubble story for the manipulation of light and especially entangled light. It remains an interesting philosophical question to ask what exactly caused what, \(M_1 \iff M_2\)?.
</p>
<h2>Subjects with mass</h2>
<p>
    I have not really looked into this yet. There is also not yet a version of the eraser experiment that tries to falsify relativistic causality using entangled particles with mass. I can imagine that if wave functions themselves live in an alternative space, properties like those of photons also appear there. It would be really cool if there is some kind of space that describes both the hilbert-space used by wave-functions and relativistic spacetime in one go. But that's beyond my capabilities.

    There's a large article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity" target="wikipedia_special_relativity">Wikipedia</a>. If you like to watch videos that are not dumbed-down and go all the way to the geometry of causality and geodesics in spacetime, see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g" target="pbs_spacetime">PBS Spacetime channel on Youtube</a>, and specifically the playlist about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsPUh22kYmNAmjsHke4pd8S9z6m_hVRur" target="pbs_spacetime">playlist about general relativity.</a>

<aside id="mass_speed_space">
    The movement of mass cannot exceed the speed of causality <em>relatively to space</em>. There is no such speed limit for space itself when stretching, bending or shrinking. For example, within the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole, space "falls" to the singularity at the center faster than light, ensuring that all possible futures lie in that singularity. A scary thought &hellip;
</aside>
<aside id="folding_space">
    Again, the causality-bubble is relative to the fabric of spacetime. It is <em>theoretically</em> possible to fold this in ways that instantaneous travel from one point in space works, without all the twin-paradox stuff. In practice, however, this cannot yet &ndash; if ever &ndash; be done and it would probably also introduce all kinds of new, interesting challenges. I suggest we leave these to those who travel at warp speeds. Engage!
</aside>
<aside id="knowing_whether_a_photon_exists">
    The observer does not always know that a photon is created for sure. There either has to be an emission event that is witnessed or predicted by the observer, the observer has to interact with it or both. Interaction also requires that the photon has a predictable path for the observer. And intercation likely kills the photon.
