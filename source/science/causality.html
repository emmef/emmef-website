    <p id="article-summary">
        Relativity states that causality travels with the speed of light.<a href="ref:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone">Light cones explained on Wikipedia</a>. The Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiment, <dfn>DCQE</dfn>, confirms that a measurement can affect another instantaneously or even retroactively.<a
            href="ref:note:dcqe"/>
        When measurements are considered events in the observers world line, a violation of causality is indeed observed.<a href="ref:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line">World line on wikipedia</a> However, when the measurements are considered from the perspective of the entangled photons pair's light-like world-lines, no causal distinction can be made between the events: emission and two measurements. The reason is that all events on a light-like world line share the same spacetime interval.<a href="ref:note:dcqe-with-mass"/> In that case, the effect of one measurement on another, <em>retroactive according to the observer with mass</em>, is not necessarily a violation of causality.
    </p>

<h2>DISCLAIMER:</h2>
<p>
    I am not a physicist and am merely interested in the topic. At this stage, the text below is merely a draft.
</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    The argument cannot be expressed without some basic knowledge of (special) relativity and quantum mechanics. There are far better introductions to theory than I can give.<a href="ref:note:intros_to_relativity"/><a href="ref:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment" target="wikipedia_double_slit">Double-slit experiment on Wikipedia</a><a href="ref:note:dcqe"/>
</p>

<h1>The experiment</h1>
<p>
    The DCQE uses photons: I do not know if versions of the experiment exist that use other mass-less particles or even particles <em>with</em> mass. If these exists, this will have consequences for the argument. However, it might also help to surface deeper implications, see &ldquo;<a href="page:4bebfdd6-e7af-4f8e-ae1d-8da03d18c7fd"/>&rdquo;. Here, the experiment is described and the argument is made using photons.
</p>
<p>
    The DCQE lets a photon travel through a double slit first. This is followed by a crystal that transforms a photon in two entangled photons, emitted in two specific directions. This setup behaves like <em>two</em> double-slit experiments and we would see similar interference patterns if we would setup screens in both directions. The first entangled photon \(p_1\) travels to a measurement device \(D_1\) that is indeed just a detector that might show an interference pattern. The second entangled photon \(p_2\) travels to another measurement device \(D_2\) that is positioned much further away, so that the \(p_2\) only reaches it <em>after</em> \(p_1\) hits \(D_1\). \(D_2\) is capable of measuring the arrival of a photon and can enable or disable measurement of <em>which-way</em> information: through which slit did the photon travel?
</p>
<p>
    It turns out that there is a perfect correspondence between \(D_2\) measuring <em>which-way</em> information and \(D_1\) <em>not</em> showing an interference pattern and the other way round.
</p>
<h1>Is causality falsified?</h1>
<p>
    Let the measurements by devices \(\{D_1,D_2\}\) correspond to measurement events \(\{E_{m1},E_{m2}\}\) and the emission of both entangled photons by the crystal to event \(E_e\). All observers agree on the speed of light and the fact that \(E_e\) preceded \(E_{m1}\) and \(E_{m2}\) plus that \(E_{m1}\) happened before \(E_{m2}\). All observers must therefore agree that \(E_{m2}\) can never affect \(E_{m1}\). Yet, doing a different measurement with \(D_2\) corresponds perfectly with seeing or not seeing an interference pattern, a pattern or blot that was created <em>before</em> \(E_{m2}\).
</p>
<p>
    Is causality falsified? As in order for \(E_{m2}\) to affect \(E_{m1}\), information must be passed from \(E_{m2}\) to \(E_{m1}\) and that cannot travel faster that \(c\). But there is something weird going on.
</p>
<p>
    Relativity states that the causal ordering of events is based on the spacetime interval between those events. Photons have no mass and <em>must</em> move with the speed of causality, better known as the speed of light. All events on the world lines of photons have the same interval. That means the interval <em>between</em> these events is zero. As a result, no causal ordering between these events can be established. This is illustrated by the fact that photons experience no time, nor distance: their complete life from creation to destruction happens immediately. Now the interpretation I'd like to propose is as follows.
</p>
<h3 id="3a034580-2776-474f-b593-e1e5fd74fa46">Proposal: light like event equivalence</h3>
<p>
    Light like event equivalence means that events on a single world line that are not causally separated, are part of the same event. Assume that the life of photon \(p_1\) consists of its emission and measurement events \(E_e\) and\(E_{m1}\). Because of the light-like world line, these events are not causally separated. Therefore, the life of \(p_1\) consists of a single event \(T_1 \equiv \{E_e,E_{m1}\}\): a transfer of energy between two points in spacetime. This energy transfer is instantaneous from the photon perspective - though it has not time to realise that. But and observer with mass is burdened by time and space. There might be billions of years between the creation and the detection of a photon. And the observer has the option to do nothing, to affect the path of the photon or to kill it by measurement.<a href="ref:note:knowing_whether_a_photon_exists"/> Whatever the observer decides: the photon immediately knows how it dies as soon as it gets created.
</p>
<h3>Does the delayed choice quantum eraser violate causality?</h3>
<p>
    Because the photons in the quantum eraser share the same emission event, we can also define \(T \equiv \{E_e,E_{m1},E_{m2}\}\): the transfer of two equal portions of energy from one point in spacetime to two other points in spacetime. Both measurements are necessarily part of the same event. They cannot be distinguished an so they <em>must</em> affect each other. Causality is not violated. And causality is the only thing all observers agree upon. The poor observer with mass has to accept that not only quantum mechanics is weird or contra intuitive&hellip;
</p>
<h1 id="4bebfdd6-e7af-4f8e-ae1d-8da03d18c7fd">Wave functions and light-like world lines</h1>
<p>
    So there is this photon in timeless, spaceless limbo and the time and space-bound observer. When the observer measures the photon in some way, it ceases to exists in exchange for <em>some</em> of its information.  According to the observer, this looks a lot like a spooky probability function that is "stretched out" over the complete eventual path of the photon. A path that is also determined by what interacts with it. This path might stretch over billions of years and kilometers or just the lab: for the photon it's all the same. If the observer <em>does not</em> measure the photon, there is only a likelihood that the photon is where observer thinks it is at that time: the actual path is only established at interaction: measurement.<a href="ref:note:knowing_whether_a_photon_exists"/> Again: this behaviour looks a lot like the spooky behavior of a wave function of a quantum system.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Disclaimer: this is really speculative and a large conceptual step</em>. In lack of better wording: <em>what if some of the events that can happen to a wave function, also have zero spacetime interval?</em> It could be interesting to see how we can combine zero-interval interpretation with quantum mechanics. It would be necessary to express the spacetime interval in the in terms of the function's mathematical space or the other way round. This is above my competence, but might open some interesting areas of research!

    There's a large article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity" target="wikipedia_special_relativity">Wikipedia</a>. If you like to watch videos that are not dumbed-down and go all the way to the geometry of causality and geodesics in spacetime, see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g" target="pbs_spacetime">PBS Spacetime channel on Youtube</a>, and specifically the playlist about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsPUh22kYmNAmjsHke4pd8S9z6m_hVRur" target="pbs_spacetime">playlist about general relativity.</a>

<aside id="mass_speed_space">
    The movement of mass cannot exceed the speed of causality <em>relatively to space</em>. There is no such speed limit for space itself when stretching, bending or shrinking. For example, within the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole, space "falls" to the singularity at the center faster than light, ensuring that all possible futures lie in that singularity. A scary thought &hellip;
</aside>
<aside id="folding_space">
    Again, the causality-bubble is relative to the fabric of spacetime. It is <em>theoretically</em> possible to fold this in ways that instantaneous travel from one point in space works, without all the twin-paradox stuff. In practice, however, this cannot yet &ndash; if ever &ndash; be done and it would probably also introduce all kinds of new, interesting challenges. I suggest we leave these to those who travel at warp speeds. Engage!
</aside>
<aside id="knowing_whether_a_photon_exists">
    The observer does not always know that a photon is created for sure. There either has to be an emission event that is witnessed or predicted by the observer, the observer has to interact with it or both. Interaction also requires that the photon has a predictable path for the observer. And intercation likely kills the photon.
</aside>
<aside id="measurement_completed">
    Naturally, the information that is revealed by both measurement devices must end up at the observer that interprets the result. Let's assume all necessary precautions have been taken to make the experiment successful.

    As far as I know, there have not been delayed choice quantum erasers that use non-photon entangled pairs.
