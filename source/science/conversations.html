    <h1>Conversations about physics explanations</h1>
    <p>
        I am not a physicist. There are a lot of physicists that explain the absolutely mind-bending fabric of our universe to laymen like me. I think it really awesome that people take the time to do this. Sometimes, I don't get it. There is nothing wrong with that, as only few people really understand the theory. And these people will be the first to admit how little they know and how limited their understanding is. When I don't get it, I think I should ask questions or propose counterarguments. It is extremely difficult to make sound arguments on dangerously different levels of simplification, interpretation or abstraction. In that case, me asking questions nad hopefully getting an answer, helps me understand better. It can also help to improve the explanation. And that, in turn, helps other people.
