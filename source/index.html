<p>
    Welcome! This page contains my ponderings about various topics. It also contains some old stuff and secretly links
    to even more, older stuff that is really hard to find. Feel free to navigate to any topics that interest you!
    This page is not designed to look glossy or arty: just to be typographically acceptable (readable) on as many
    media/devices as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Be warned! The page in its current form is relatively new and therefore has relatively little content. "Therefore",
    because of my inherent speed-of-producing-content-limit, combined with my inability to escape the default flow of
    time. Sorry for that! </p>
<p>
    Another warning is in place. Some topics are in my native language Dutch as, for me, it lends itself better to
    express complex or subtle matters. </p>
<p>
    Yet another warning! Some topics have some mathematics in them. I will <em>try</em><a
        href="ref:note:LimitedDidacticCapability"/> to keep it to a minimum and only for clarification, proof, accuracy
    or support.

<aside id="LimitedDidacticCapability">
    As my didactic capabilities are limited, it might be that I can only express stuff mathematically. Again: sorry for
    that.
