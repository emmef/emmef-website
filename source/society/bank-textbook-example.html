    For this explanation, the economy contains a fixed amount of money that does not change during the example. There is
    only one bank that has two kinds of accounts: payment accounts without interest and savings accounts with interest.
    This explanation does not describe reality, so reading it as if you have no previous knowledge of banking is
    advisable. </p>
<p>
    In an ideal situation, all money circulates continuously between payment accounts: it is spent all the time. Some
    people cannot spend all the money they get and the want to save that up. Some entrepreneurs temporarily need extra
    money to make nice things happen. If savings would take money out of circulation that could be used by
    entrepreneurs, that would be a waste! The savings account solves this problem, without the need for one on one
    transactions between entrepreneurs and people with savings. </p>
<p>
    Let's take a look at the bank that has, for example, 4 creditors with savings accounts SA&nbsp;&hellip; SA&nbsp;4
    and a total amount of savings \(T_s\) <a href="ref:note:SavingsOwnership"/>:</p>
<section>
    <table class="colorbox">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2" width="20%">SA&nbsp;1</td>
            <td colspan="3" width="30%">SA&nbsp;2</td>
            <td colspan="1" width="10%">SA&nbsp;3</td>
            <td colspan="4" width="40%">SA&nbsp;4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="10">\(T_s\)</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    The bank is allowed to lend out savings to debtors. Because lending out money involves a certain risk and there's
    always a chance of creditors that take their money out of their savings account, the bank is legally obligated to
    retain a certain percentage of the money that it manages. This is called the minimum buffer percentage, \(b\) that
    needs to be larger than zero but lower than a hundred percent. The total amount of outstanding debt, \(T_d\) and the
    buffer \(B\) can be pictured as follows:</p>

    <table class="colorbox">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2" width="20%">SA&nbsp;1</td>

            <td colspan="4" width="40%">SA&nbsp;4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="10">\(T_s\)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="8">\( T_d &lt; (1 - b)T_s\)</td>

    <h2>How does lending out work?</h2>
    <p>
        When the bank lends out money, it creates a contract that describes the amount of money and a schedule for both
        repaying the money and paying the interest. Sometimes, additional conditions apply, such as surity. When this
        contract is signed by bank and debtor, the bank moves money from the pool of savings to the payment account of
        the debtor. The debtor can then move this money from the payment account to the payment account of someone else.
        As long as the debtor meets the criteria in the debt-contract, everything works.
</section>
<p>
    It is possible that a debtor cannot repay his debt or the interest that is due. This is the reason that there must
    always be a buffer of money that is not lend out. In addition, interest income can also be added as extra
    buffer. </p>
<section>
    <h2>Bank-run</h2>
    <p>
        Imagine that a large percentage of the money in savings accounts is pulled out by the owners of the accounts. If
        the bank already has the maximum amount of money lend out, it needs to violate the law to give that money back.
        Therefore, banks need an additional buffer on top of the minimum allowed by law. In addition, banks will also
        offer accounts that need people to keep the savings for at least a fixed a mount of time, so that risk is
        reduced. </p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Multiplying money</h2>
    <p>
        As said the debtor is free to use the loan as desired, apart from the schedule of repayment and paying debt and
        additional criteria in the debt-contract. The debtor could be payed in full to a landlord. This landlord could
        then transfer the money from his payment to his savings account. In turn, this means that the bank is allowed to
        lend out more money. Which could, again, end up on a savings account. And so on. With a buffer percentage \(b\)
        this leads to a maximum percveived growth of money in circulation of \( \frac{1}{b}-1 \) <a
            href="ref:note:MoneyGrowth"/>.</p>
</section>
<aside id="SavingsOwnership">
    Here, only savings are mentioned, hence \(T_s\), while equity <a href="ref:note:Equity"/> should also count towards
    this number. This is irrelevant to <em>this</em> story and was therefore omitted.
</aside>
<aside id="Equity">
    Equity: The money that would be left to pay to the owners of the bank if it would sell all its possessions and pay
    off its liabilities first. As the owners of the bank are not modelled in this textbook example, consider the people
    with savings as the owners of the bank, which is not that far from reality.
</aside>
<aside id="MoneyGrowth">
    <p>Imagine a buffer percentage of \(b\) and an original amount of savings \(T_{s}\). A buffer percentage of \(b\)
        means that we can rent out a percentage \(a\), where \(a = 1 - b\). The maximum money given to debtors can now
        be \(T_d = aT_s\). If all this money goes to savings accounts, we can lend out more money: \(T_d = a (a T_s) =
        a^2 T_s\). If all <em>that</em> money goes to savings accounts, we can <em>again</em> lend out more money: \(T_d
        = a ( a^2 T_s) = a^3 T_s\). If we repeat this endlessly, we get:</p>
    $$ T_d = T_s \sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty {a^i} $$
    <p>Yielding</p>
    $$ T_d = - T_s + T_s \sum\limits_{i=0}^\infty {a^i} = (-1 + \sum\limits_{i=0}^\infty {a^i})T_s$$
    <p>Which contains a known power-series sum, so we get</p>
    $$ T_d = (-1 + \frac{1}{1 - a})T_s $$
    <p>and as \(a = 1 - b \), this boils down to </p>
    $$ T_d = ( \frac{1}{b} - 1 )T_s$$
    <p>This means that if the buffer percentage is 10%, any saved amount of money would appear 9 times in circulation.
        It is possible to reason in such a way that in practice, this percentage is always approachable. I leave that to
        economists.</p>
