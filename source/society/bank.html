    How does a bank work in the modern economy? Unfortunately, there is a lot of nonsense going round, even in
    textbooks, see <a href="page:3f99fddd-ffde-49e3-91f3-3f6ce732aec4">the textbook example</a>. Fortunately, there
    are also excellent
    papers<a
        href="ref:http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q1prereleasemoneycreation.pdf">Bank
    of England, quarterly bulletin 2014Q1, <em>&ldquo;money creation in the modern economy&rdquo;</em></a> that explain
    how banks work. </p>
<p>
    On this page, the working of banks in our economy will be described without slang or terminology that is not
    explicitly defined. Where necessary, the economy lives on a far away and isolated island, yet without violating
    reality. </p>
