    <h1 id="article-summary-title">Can interest be payed without first taking on more, new debt?</h1>
    <p id="article-summary">
        In general, the person that lends out Money will ask interest payment. In the modern economy, bank credit is
        money creation in the form of debt. Repaying debt destroys money. The debt money was created, but not the
        interest that needs to be payed extra. This can lead to the conclusion that it is not (always) possible to pay
        that interest without someone (else) taking on more debt first. A conclusion that will be denied by banks and
        economists. Two extreme positions are explored here and it needs to be seen what can be learned. </p>
</section>
<p>
    The first extreme position is that it is <em>mathematically impossible</em> to repay all debt and the additional
    interest. As it is easy to contrive <a href="#a8f845bc-1d91-4006-9928-e917bf336a54">an example</a> were both debt
    and interest <em>are payed back</em>, this position can be falsified right away. </p>
<p>
    The second extreme position states that is <em>always possible</em> to repay debt and the additional interest. The
    given reason is that interest will always flow back into the economy as costs completely. Here it becomes
    interesting. It is easy to contrive <a href="b52d8278-60ae-487a-9867-fb1ab59ea068">another example</a>, where
    interest <em>does not</em> flow back into the economy completely, for instance when a bank decides to add a
    percentage of the earned interest to the capital base instead of spending it back into the economy right away.
    However, this example has side-effects that might have the same effect as spending money back and thus needs more
    analysis. Here it becomes even more interesting. If the mentioned side-effects are not watertight or have a
    structural delay: that falsifies this second position. Because this position requires that interest returns into the
    economy for the full 100% and without structural delay. These &ldquo;inefficiencies&rdquo; will then create a
    structural need for more credit. If that need is a steady percentage of total debt, we have exponential growth of
    total-debt, a steady percentage of defaults or a mix of both. </p>
<p>
    As of this writing &ndash; September 9<sup>th</sup> 2017 &ndash; I do not know the outcome. </p>

        This is a free adaptation of the story on Positive Money<a
            href="ref:http://positivemoney.org/2017/02/interest/">Positive Money &ndash; is there enough money to pay
        off all the interest?</a> that debunks the fact that it is mathematically impossible to pay back interest. </p>

<p>
    Alice the entrepreneur wants to borrow 100 credits. George agrees and demands 10% interest. The 100 credits are
    called the <em>principal </em> of the loan, due in a year. The 100 credits are added to Alice's balance and in one
    year from now, Alice needs to repay George 100 credits and an extra 10 credits as interest: a total of 110 credits.
</p>
<p>
    Alice first buys a machine from Pete (50 credits) that enables her to create stuff. She also buys bread from Bob (10
    credits). During the year, Bob, Alice and Pete exchange money on their balances for goods. Alice makes "stuff", Bob
    bread and Pete machines. Naturally, Alice makes sure she has the 100 credits back in time to repay her debt. </p>
<p>
    Just before the principal and interest are due, Alice pays George the interest in advance: her balance becomes 90
    and George's 10 credits. Now George buys 10 credits of breads from Bob and Bob uses that to buy 10 credits of
    "stuff" from Alice, so Alice, again, has 100 credits. Then she repays George, who dutifully resets her balance to
    zero.<a href="ref:note:FactsAndRules"/> In numbers: </p>

    <h2>What's wrong with this story?</h2>
    <p>Even though the story proves that it is not mathematically <em>impossible</em> to repay debt and the additional
        interest: it is a rather contrived story: all inhabitants must make the right decisions at the right time.
        Reality is messy, so this "model" of a society is too simplistic. Let's make it more interesting!

<aside id="FactsAndRules">
    <p>Here are some facts and rules on the island:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FACT1</strong>: The island has four inhabitants: George, Alice, Bob and Pete</li>
        <li><strong>FACT2</strong>: The island has one bank, worth 1000 credits and owned by George. The credits
            actually were rare stones.
        </li>
        <li><strong>FACT3</strong>: None of the inhabitants except George, have stones, though they can have other
            property but that is not generally acceptable as payment.
        </li>
        <li><strong>FACT4</strong>: All the inhabitants, including George, have a balance at George's bank, that starts
            out empty. People used to carry around the original stones from George that made up the bank. Now, the
            balances are just numbers. But the stones might still be there!
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE1</strong>: Nobody is legally bound to accept anything but balance payments. In other words:
            number on balances are the only possible legal tender.
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE2</strong>: If asked, George can add a number to an inhabitant's (debtor's) balance that
            represents the principal of a loan. A represents a debt that must be repayed in a limited amount of time. In
            addition, the debtor will pay a negotiated percentage of interest per year over the amount of the principal
            that has not yet been repaid.
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE3</strong>: The bank is only allowed to lend out as much money as it is worth, or a fixed
            multiple thereof: leverage
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE4</strong>: Repaying debt means that George lessens the amount on the balance of the inhabitant.
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE5</strong>: Paying interest means that the inhabitant's balance is decreased with the same
            amount that George's balance gets increased.
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE6</strong>: It is possible for inhabitants to become partial owner of the bank by allowing the
            bank to diminish their accounts in exchange for ownership-papers.
        </li>
    </ul>
