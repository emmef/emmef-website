    In general, the person that lends you Money will ask you to pay interest. In the modern economy, bank credit is
    money creation. Repaying you debt (is equal to credit), will destroy money. But you also need to pay additional
    interest and that money was not created at the time you got your interest. This can lead to the conclusion that it
    is not (always) possible to pay that interest without someone (else) taking on more debt first. So let's ask the
    question: </p>
<blockquote>Is it possible to pay all interest on current outstanding debt, without someone having to take on more debt
    first?
</blockquote>
<p>
    There are two extreme positions that can be found on the internet and in literature: </p>
<ol>
    <li>It is mathematically impossible!</li>
    <li>It is always possible, as interest always returns back in the economy as costs like salaries that can be used to
        pay the interest.
    </li>

</ol>
<p>
    When I read a phrase like &ldquo;mathematically impossible&rdquo; I am immediately interested, but often
    disappointed afterwards. Because the &ldquo;proof&rdquo; is often a single prosaic example and not a rigorous proof.
    And to be honest, the people that say it's always possible have a better example that is often more factually
    correct. Still: they also have a limited number of examples. Both parties have. If we assume that both parties can
    come up with examples that withstand close scrutiny, the only <em>logical</em> conclusion is that both are wrong.<a

<p>
    Timing of choices is an essential factor in stories about interest. It is also important to be sharp on types of
    money and whether they can be exchanged freely. Capital is not always legal tender and thus paying someone with
    capital still requires legal tender to exchange in most cases. Most of our money is borrowed into existence as
    payment account balance. However, bank accounts make no distinction between money that was the result of credit or
    because of cash traded for balance. Therefore, cash is ignored unless absolutely necessary. All events take
    place on an island, where some facts are true and some rules must be obeyed.<a

    <h1>How interest flows back into the economy</h1>
    <p>
        This is a free adaptation of the story on Positive Money<a
            href="ref:http://positivemoney.org/2017/02/interest/">Positive Money &ndash; is there enough money to pay
        off all the interest?</a> that debunks the fact that it is mathematically impossible to pay back interest.</p>

<p>
    Alice the entrepreneur wants to borrow 100 credits. George agrees and demands 10% interest. The 100 credits are
    called the <em>principal </em> of the loan, due in a year. The 100 credits are added to Alice's balance and in one
    year from now, Alice needs to repay George 100 credits and an extra 10 credits as interest: a total of 110 credits.
</p>
<p>
    Alice first buys a machine from Pete that enables her to create stuff. She also pays Bob as he makes bread. During
    the year, Bob, Alice and Pete exchange money on their balances for goods. Alice makes sure she has the 100 credits
    back in time to repay her debt. </p>
<p>
    But how is she going to pay back 110 credits with only a hundred in existence as legal tender? </p>
<p>
    In this scenario, Alice pays George the interest in advance: her balance becomes 90 an George's 10 credits. George
    needs to eat too and pays Bob 10 credits for bread. Again, Bob buys Alice's stuff and her balance will contain the
    100 credits at the end of the last day. Then she repays George, who dutifully resets her balance to zero. In
    numbers:

    <h2>What's wrong with this story?</h2>
    <p>Even though the story proves that it is not mathematically <em>impossible</em> to repay debt and the additional
        interest: it is a rather contrived story. All inhabitants must make the right decisions at the right time. That
        is hardly realistic. It is easy to tell a story that forces at least one of the inhabitants to take a new loan
        in order to make interest payment possible.</p>
</section>
<p>The story also shows that no transactions can be done at all if there is no credit in the economy. George is the only
    person that has capital that can be used to create credit. Naturally, other inhabitants can exchange actual goods,
    but that soon becomes cumbersome. Unless they, of course, create their own accounting system outside of George's
    control. </p>
<p>
    I mentioned that decisions and timing are essential. So let's explore that a little further.</p>

<aside id="DoubleDenial">
    <p>
        Assume that both parties have a few correct examples to support their propositions. Such an example will
        describe a sequence of events or decisions that lead to a situation in which all interest cannot or can be payed
        back. As soon as <em>both</em> parties can come up with correct examples, the proposition that states
        impossibility, looses, as there is at least one example that shows that under some circumstances, it is possible
        to pay back interest without new credit. However, as there is also a correct example that shows that under some
        circumstances, it is not possible to pay the interest without new credit, the &ldquo;always&rdquo; part of the
        other proposition can not be upheld. </p>
</aside>
<aside id="History">
    <p>
        History of the bank. Originally, credits were very valuable stones that George owned and the bank was literally
        his create of stones. When people needed money, they could lend some stones, as long as he would get them back
        with interest. However, exchanging stones became cumbersome and sometimes inhabitants wanted to trade
        half-stones and such. Also, George didn't know what kind of deals people made and some people should be
        protected from others or prevented to make deals. That is when George introduced ledgers, later to be replaced
        by balance accounts. </p>
</aside>
<aside id="FactsAndRules">
    <p>Here are some facts and rules on the island:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FACT1</strong>: The island has three inhabitants: George, Alice, Bob and Pete</li>
        <li><strong>FACT2</strong>: The island has one bank, worth 1000 credits and owned by George. The credits
            actually were rare stones.
        </li>
        <li><strong>FACT3</strong>: None of the inhabitants except George, have stones, though they can have other
            property but that is not generally acceptable as payment.
        </li>
        <li><strong>FACT4</strong>: All the inhabitants, including George, have a balance at George's bank, that starts
            out empty. People used to carry around the original stones from George that made up the bank. Now, the
            balances are just numbers. But the stones might still be there!
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE1</strong>: Nobody is legally bound to accept anything but balance payments. In other words:
            number on balances are the only possible legal tender.
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE2</strong>: If asked, George can add a number to an inhabitant's (debtor's) balance that
            represents the principal of a loan. A represents a debt that must be repayed in a limited amount of time. In
            addition, the debtor will pay a negotiated percentage of interest per year over the amount of the principal
            that has not yet been repaid.
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE3</strong>: The bank is only allowed to lend out as much money as it is worth</li>
        <li></li>
        <li><strong>RULE4</strong>: Repaying debt means that George lessens the amount on the balance of the
            inhabitant.
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE5</strong>: Paying interest means that the inhabitant's balance is decreased with the same
            amount that George's balance gets increased.
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE6</strong>: It is possible for inhabitants to become partial owner of the bank by allowing the
            bank to diminish their accounts in exchange for ownership-papers.</li>
    </ul>
