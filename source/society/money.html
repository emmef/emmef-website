    There are many kinds of Money but not all of them are legal tender or currency. Then we have central banks and fiat,
    gold-standard or debt-Money. How come that all countries have huge debts, but also most households? Who owns that
    debt? </p>
<p>
    Most people have lost track or were never so interested from the beginning. However, the way that we as a society
    shape Money has a huge impact on equality or which parts of the population get chances and opportunities and which
    do not. People not knowing is one of the reasons the financial hurts society and gets away with it, supported by
    politicians and mainstream economic scientists. </p>
<p>
    First, it must be explained what money is. Money can be explained as a means of exchange, as debt or as both. Money
    is not equivalent to value, not to currency and not to legal tender. For example, a bartender-note that expresses
    that you promise to pay for ordered drinks, does represent money, but nobody has to accept it as payment. It is a
    debt, a promise: future money. </p>
<p>
    Second, it is explained what types of money <em>are</em> legal tender, how the payment system works and mentions
    some problems with the current implementation. One problem is that the current setup forces governments to bail out
    large commercial banks. Banks that would not survive in a real free market. Bailing out moves the burden from the
    bad bank to more capable institutions and society as a whole. It also sends the wrong message. The alternative is
    worse: the payment system will fail and that means nobody can trust another party to pay, even if that party has
    enough money on its payment account. </p>
<p>
    Third, I'd like to go into a specific type of Money: credit (or debt). How it works at present and what the problems
    of the current system are for society as a whole. I will approach this in a naive way with well known examples that
    are used by bankers and economists. However, I will refrain from using slang and the assumptions those people make
    and combine it with a little math. Let's see if the results actually match the mainstream ones or not. To be honest:
    I will know when I get there. </p>
