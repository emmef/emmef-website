    <h1 id="article-summary-title">Can interest be payed only by incurring new debt?</h1>
    <p id="article-summary">
        In general, the person that lends out Money will ask interest for that service. In the modern economy, bank credit <em>creates</em> money in the form of debt, while repaying debt <em>destroys</em> it. The interest money is not created with the loan. Some propose that it is <em>therefore impossible</em> to pay that interest without someone (else) taking on more debt first. It turns out taking the extra debt <em>is</em> necessary, however, not because of the interest. Fun!</p>

    <h1>The used money system</h1>
    <p>
        The &ldquo;money system&rdquo;<a href="ref:note:MoneySystemFactsAndRules"/> used to explore the scenario, is necessary and sufficient. Necessary, because we need at least a proper concept of a bank with balance accounts for each participant. To keep the number of involved elements small, the bank and its participant, that include the owner, are situated on an island. The system is also sufficient, as all interactions that take place, including those in the critique that follows, can be perfectly described with the available elements and concepts.</p>
</section>
<p>
    If we accept the proposition that all interest must be borrowed into existence, this roughly means that (in average) for each period of time (principal due period), we need to borrow an extra amount of money (the interest) into existence. As the interest is roughly proportional to the principal and thus the amount of money in circulation (that is the amount of not yet paid back principal), this leads to a roughly exponential growth. It will be shown, however, that this proposition is false.

<h2 id="32ed9a8a-975b-4632-9192-1180973efde3">The story of Alice</h2>
<p>
    On day 1, Alice wants to borrow 100 credits for one year. George agrees and demands 10% interest for the whole year. The 100 credits are called the <em>principal </em> of the loan, due in a year. The 100 credits are added to Alice's balance and in one year from now, Alice needs to repay George 100 credits and an extra 10 credits as interest: a total of 110 credits.
</p>
<p>
    The total amount of legal tender in circulation is now 100 credits.
</p>
<p>
    On day 2, Alice buys a machine from Pete (50 credits) that enables her to create stuff. She also buys bread from Bob (10 credits).
</p>
<p>
    During the year, Bob, Alice and Pete exchange money on their balances for goods. Alice makes "stuff", Bob bread and Pete machines. Naturally, Alice makes sure she has the 100 credits back in time to repay her debt!
</p>
<p>
    On day 361, just before the principal and interest are due, Alice pays George the interest in advance: her balance becomes 90 and George's 10 credits.
</p>
<p>
    George now has 10 credits of legal tender to buy breads from Bob on day 363 and Bob uses that to buy 10 credits of "stuff" from Alice on day 364. So Alice, again, has 100 credits! Then she repays her debt to George on day 265, who dutifully resets her balance to zero, thereby also reducing the total amount of legal tender in circulation to zero.<a href="ref:note:MoneySystemFactsAndRules"/>

    <h2 id="e2ef694f-40aa-48fb-950b-7a665a7857d1">Critique</h2>
    <p>
        Even though the story proves that it is possible that Alice pays her debt without anyone else taking out a loan: it is a rather contrived scenario where all inhabitants must make certain types of decisions and at the right time. Only then the flow of money that starts at the loan and ends at the payback, is fully circular. This scenario also plays in complete isolation of all other scenarios, a fact that is hardly realistic. This scenario will be referred to as scenario <var>A</var> (from &ldquo;Alice&rdquo;).
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine that in a scenario <var>A'</var>, Bob decides to keep the 10 credits on day 364, instead paying them to Alice. He is allowed to do that and it is pretty realistic, considering all the great movies coming out next month. However: Bob's decisions disrupts the flow of money back to Alice, so Alice cannot pay back her loan on time. Because of Bob's decision, <em>the flow of credits is not fully circular in the considered time interval</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Several things can happen. Alice and George (the bank) might agree on a new, temporary loan for Alice, so that the flow can be restored, later: let's call this scenario <var>A''</var>. It can also be that George extends the length of the loan, so that the flow can be restored: let's call this scenario <var>A'''</var>. It can also be that George (the bank) sees that after any of <var>A'</var>, <var>A''</var> or <var>A'''</var>, the flow back to Alice will still not be restored and never will be. In that case, George (the bank) can allow Alice to default on the loan ad write it off. This can do interesting things to the grand-total of balances and unwinding things can be challenging, however, it is out of scope here.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whatever decisions Alice and George make: Alice and George have a pretty sound overview of the situation. Scenarios  <var>A</var> to <var>A'''</var> each happen in their own universe and in complete isolation of all other possible scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a real world, more scenarios happen at the same time and there can be multiple banks. It is pretty realistic to assume that Bob uses another bank than Alice and that legal tender can easily transfer from Bob's bank to Alice's and vice versa.<a href="ref:note:moving_stones"/> Assume that another scenario <var>B</var> overlaps (in time) with <var>A'</var> and one of the participants in <var>B</var>, Handyman, pays 10 credits to Alice on day 364. Handyman effectively &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; scenario <var>A'</var> as Alice now is able to pay back her principal in time! However, all scenarios should eventually end in paying back the principal, resetting the grand-total to what it was on day zero of the scenario. Handyman fixed <var>A'</var> but broke <var>B</var> with an amount of 10 credits! It can be shown that a decision like Bob's in <var>A'</var> cannot be fixed without either a default. In all other cases it will <em>propagate</em> through all scenarios that overlap in time (recursively). It can also be shown that there is no way to reorder scenarios in such a way that all of them are fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, the bank just needs to allow a default, right?
    </p>
    <p>
        Even with just one bank, it is complex to track all IOUs on the island if different scenarios happen and overlap in time, let alone if there are multiple banks. In reality, as a result of Handyman;s decision, George will assume the problem is fixed. However, as mentioned before, the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; of 10 credits propagates to other scenarios (<var>B</var>). And the flow of credits in scenario <var>A'</var> cannot be considered fully circular, because of the &ldquo;alien&rdquo; money. Because new scenarios happen all the time, it is highly likely that no bank will recognise when a default should happen. The result is that scenarios that happen later will <em>cover up</em> the defect in circular money flow, <em>by taking on new debt</em>. This is recursive.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the &ndash; acknowledged: crude &ndash; assumptions are made that on average the the money flow is only circular for less than 100%, and a certain number of transactions is made per period of time, we can make a crude prediction of what will happen. As the total amount of money in circulation is equal to the total of grand-totals for all scenarios, the defect in circular money flow is proportional to the total amount of money in circulation. Per period of time, this defect needs to be borrowed into existing by newer scenarios. And this is awfully familiar to a system with positive feedback, where the total amount of money in circulation MUST grow exponentially to prevent breakdown &ndash; awfully many breakdowns.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The proposition that money to pay back interest needs to be borrowed into existence, is false, as can be shown by analysing a simple, micro-economic system. However, expanding the analysis to a more realistic non-micro system also leads to a demand for money to be borrowed into existence, to prevent breakdown. This also leads to an exponential growth of the amount of money in circulation. This leads to the conclusion that the proposition is wrong, but the outcome is right.

<aside id="MoneySystemFactsAndRules">
    <p>The money system is described by the following facts and rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FACT0</strong>: <em>Everything</em> happens on the island (and stays on the island).</li>
        <li><strong>FACT1</strong>: The island has four inhabitants: George, Alice, Bob and Pete</li>
        <li><strong>FACT2</strong>: The island has one bank, worth 1000 credits and owned by George. The credits actually are rare stones.
        </li>
        <li><strong>FACT3</strong>: None of the inhabitants except George, have stones, though they can have other property but that is not generally legal tender and this not acceptable as payment.
        </li>
        <li><strong>FACT4</strong>: All the inhabitants, including George, have a balance at George's bank, that starts out empty. People used to carry around the original stones from George that made up the bank. Now, the balances are just numbers. But the stones might still be there!
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE1</strong>: Nobody is legally bound to accept anything but balance payments. In other words: number on balances are the only possible legal tender.
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE2</strong>: If asked, George can add a number to an inhabitant's (debtor's) balance that represents the principal of a loan. A represents a debt that must be repaid in a limited amount of time. In addition, the debtor will pay a negotiated percentage of interest per year over the amount of the principal that has not yet been repaid.<br/><em>This interaction increases the grand-total of all balance accounts with the principal.</em>
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE3</strong>: The bank is only allowed to lend out as much money as it is worth, or a fixed
            multiple thereof: leverage
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE4</strong>: Repaying debt means that George lessens the amount on the balance of the inhabitant and removes it. <br/><em>This interaction decreases the grand-total of all balance accounts with the amount of debt that is repayed.</em>
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE5</strong>: Paying interest means that the inhabitant's balance is decreased with the same
            amount that George's balance gets increased.
        </li>
        <li><strong>RULE6</strong>: It is possible for inhabitants to become partial owner of the bank by allowing the
            bank to diminish their accounts in exchange for ownership-papers.
        </li>
    </ul>

<aside id="LegalTenderIsDebt">
    In all scenarios, there are facts to take into account and rules to play by.<a href="ref:note:MoneySystemFactsAndRules"/> In
    this case: interest can only be payed with legal tender: money on a balance account. The only way to obtain money on
    a balance account is to take on debt.<a href="ref:note:CashCurrency"/> Hence, if the interest (in the <a
        href="#a8f845bc-1d91-4006-9928-e917bf336a54">direct spending of interest</a> scenario) is not fully spent before
    the payback is due, other money needs to be available to repay the remainder. This money is debt that was already in
    circulation or a temporary new debt that must be taken.
</aside>
<aside id="CashCurrency">
    In this system, cash is not considered. Cash can be exchanged for balance account money. The large majority of
    money, however, is debt. It might be interesting to see how the quantitative aspects of the whole money-debt system
    turn out to see what the role of cash is.
</aside>

<aside id="OneOnOneLendingRisk">
    It is often claimed that the described money system &ndash; that is similar to the current money system &ndash;
    reduces the so-called one on one lending risk: If I lend my money to someone, there is always the chance that I will
    not get it back, let alone the added interest. In the described system, I can put money in a savings account at the
    bank. As the bank creates money for loans rather than lending out these savings, it is concluded that the system
    prevents the one to one lending risk. Though this is true, it is true for any money system. It is always possible to
    create mediator, a fund where many people put their savings and where that fund lends out part of that money to many
    other people, thereby taking away the one on one lending risk. This is actually how most people think a banks work.
    As a follow up argument it is then stated that the risk of participating in such a fund, is higher than a bank
    creating new money on lending. However, if you trace all risk a little more thoroughly, there really not that much
    difference.
</aside>
<aside id="exploratory">
    This simple reasoning is just exploratory example and it might be that I overlooked things or missed a stabilising mechanism.
</aside>
<aside id="orlendextra">
    The bank could also add another loan and hope that eventually the scenario <em>does</em> play out well. This, however, makes the scenario a more complex composite, however, without adding essential different concepts.
</aside>
<aside id="moving_stones">
    The two banks should agree that the effective amount of balance credits that transferred from one bank to another at the end of the day, also implies an appropriate (equivalent) transport of rare stones.
