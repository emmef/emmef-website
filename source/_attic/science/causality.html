<h1>The experiment</h1>
<p>
    The experiment and the argument that I will propose, cannot be expressed without some basic knowledge of (special) relativity and quantum mechanics. There are far better sources than I could ever produce.<a href="ref:note:intros_to_relativity"/><a href="ref:note:double-slit"/><a href="ref:note:dcqe"/>
</p>
<p>
    The <dfn><abbr title="Delayed choice quantum eraser">DCQE</abbr></dfn> lets a photon travel through a double slit first.<a href="ref:note:dcqe-with-mass"/> This is followed by a crystal that transforms a photon in two entangled photons, emitted in two specific directions. This setup behaves like <em>two</em> double-slit experiments and we would see similar interference patterns if we would setup screens in both directions. The first entangled photon \(p_1\) travels to a measurement device \(D_1\) that is indeed just a detector that might shows an interference pattern or a blot. The second entangled photon \(p_2\) travels to another measurement device \(D_2\). \(D_2\) is positioned much further away, so that the \(p_2\) only reaches it <em>after</em> \(p_1\) hits \(D_1\). \(D_2\) is capable of measuring the arrival of a photon and can enable or disable measurement of <em>which-way</em> information.<a href="ref:note:double-slit"/>
</p>
<p>
    It turns out that there is a perfect correspondence between \(D_2\) measuring <em>which-way</em> information and \(D_1\) <em>not</em> showing an interference pattern (and the other way round). The funny thing is that the measurement by \(D_2\) only takes place way <em>after</em> the pattern was (or was not) formed by \(D_1\).
</p>
<p>
    Let the measurements by devices \(\{D_1,D_2\}\) correspond to measurement <em>events</em> \(\{E_{m1},E_{m2}\}\) and the emission of both entangled photons by the crystal to event \(E_e\). All observers agree on the speed of light and the fact that \(E_e\) preceded \(E_{m1}\) and \(E_{m2}\) plus that \(E_{m1}\) happened before \(E_{m2}\). All observers must therefore agree that \(E_{m2}\) can never affect \(E_{m1}\), heck: the light bubble of \(E_{m2}\) was not even formed when \(E_{m1}\) took place! Yet, doing a different measurement with \(D_2\) corresponds <em>perfectly</em> with seeing a blot or an interference pattern at \(D_1\), that was formed <em>before</em> \(E_{m2}\). It looks like information was passed from \(E_{m2}\) to \(E_{m1}\) <em>retroactively</em> and causality is violated. Let's take a closer look&hellip;
</p>
<h1 id="3a034580-2776-474f-b593-e1e5fd74fa46">Light like event equivalence</h1>
<p>
    Relativity states that the causal ordering of events - can one event have affected or caused another - is based on the <dfn>spacetime interval</dfn> between those events. Photons have no mass and <em>must</em> move with the speed of causality, better known as the speed of light, \(c\). All events on the world line of something moving with \(c\), have the same interval.<a href="ref:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line">World line on wikipedia</a> That means the interval <em>between</em> these events is zero. As a result, no causal ordering between these events can be established.<a href="ref:note:photon-timeless"/>
</p>
<p>
    The <dfn><abbr title="Light like event equivalence">LLEE</abbr></dfn> <dfn></dfn>proposal is that <q>events on a single world line and that cannot be causally separated, are part of the same event</q>. For example, assume that the life of photon \(p_1\) consists of its emission and measurement events \(E_e\) and\(E_{m1}\). Because of the light-like world line, these events are not causally separated. Therefore, the life of \(p_1\) consists of a single event \(T_1 \equiv \{E_e,E_{m1}\}\): a transfer of energy between two points in spacetime. This energy transfer is instantaneous and independent of distance from the <q>photon-perspective</q>. However, most observers have mass. A photon that travelled billions of light-years might have its extraordinary journey ended as background noise in a Selfie. The observer also has the option to do nothing, to affect the path of the photon or to kill it by measurement.<a href="ref:note:knowing_whether_a_photon_exists"/> Not that the photon realises or cares!
</p>
<h2>Causality is not falsified with LLEE</h2>
<p>
    Because the photons in the quantum eraser share the same emission event, we can also define \(T \equiv \{E_e,E_{m1},E_{m2}\}\): the transfer of two equal portions of energy from one point in spacetime to two other points in spacetime. Both measurements are necessarily part of the same event and the way that \(E_{m2}\) is executed, is a <em>part of</em> \(T\).
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, causality is not violated if LLEE holds. Causality is the only thing all observers agree upon. The poor observer with mass has to accept that not only quantum mechanics is weird or contra intuitive&hellip;
</p>
<h1 id="4bebfdd6-e7af-4f8e-ae1d-8da03d18c7fd">Wave functions and light-like world lines</h1>
<p>
    So there is this photon in timeless, spaceless limbo and the time and space-bound observer. When the observer measures the photon in some way, it ceases to exists in exchange for <em>some</em> of its information.  According to the observer, this looks a lot like a spooky function, <q>stretched out</q> over the complete  path that the photon follows, that includes its creation and destruction. What interacts with it becomes part of the path.<a href="ref:note:knowing_whether_a_photon_exists"/> This description bears similarities with the wave function of a particle with mass. Let me make a wild speculation. Assume that proporties and values of a wave function are events on a light-like fabric. This way, interacting with a wave function affects the whole wave-function, independent of observed time and space. Interacting with a particle should therefore have instantaneous effect, independent of distance. Without violating causality.

    There's a large article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity" target="wikipedia_special_relativity">Wikipedia</a>.

<aside id="knowing_whether_a_photon_exists">
    The observer does not always know that a photon is created for sure. There either has to be an emission event that is witnessed or predicted by the observer, the observer has to interact with it or both. Interaction also requires that the photon has a predictable path for the observer. And intercation likely kills the photon.

    As far as I know, there have not been delayed choice quantum erasers that use non-photon entangled pairs.

<aside id="double-slit">
    See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment" target="wikipedia_double_slit">Double-slit experiment</a> on Wikipedia. Here it is also shown that determining through which slit a particle went - <em>which-way</em> information - makes the interference pattern disappear.
</aside>
<aside id="photon-timeless">
    This is illustrated by the fact that photons experience no time, nor distance: from their perspective, their complete life from creation to destruction happens simultaneously without travelling any distance.
