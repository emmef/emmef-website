    Money: the <em>root of all</em> or a <em>necessary</em> evil? </p>
<p>
    It think it is a little of both and in the middle. A lot of evil or harm is caused by way the money system was
    designed: but not <em>all</em>. Money is not necessary, but very practical. The current money system is very
    practical, though a lot can be improved. </p>
<p>
    First, it must be explained what money is. Money can be explained as a means of exchange, as debt or as both. Money
    is not equivalent to value, not to currency and not to legal tender. For example, a bartender-note that expresses
    that you promise to pay for ordered drinks, does represent money, but nobody has to accept it as payment. It is a
    debt, a promise: future money. </p>
<p>
    Second, it is explained what types of money <em>are</em> legal tender, how the payment system works and mentions
    some problems with the current implementation. One problem is that the current setup forces governments to bail out
    large commercial banks. Banks that would not survive in a real free market. Bailing out moves the burden from the
    bad bank to more capable institutions and society as a whole. It also sends the wrong message. The alternative is
    worse: the payment system will fail and that means nobody can trust another party to pay, even if that party has
    enough money on its payment account. </p>
<p>
    Third, I'd like to go into a specific type of Money: credit (or debt). How it works at present and what the problems
    of the current system are for society as a whole. I will approach this in a naive way with well known examples that
    are used by bankers and economists. However, I will refrain from using slang and the assumptions those people make
    and combine it with a little math. Let's see if the results actually match the mainstream ones or not. To be honest:
    I will know when I get there. </p>
